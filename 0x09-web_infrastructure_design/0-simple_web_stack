- ISSUES WITH THIS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE:
- SPOF (Single Point of Failure): the system does not have any supporting component that can enable it keep on providing services in the event of any component failure.

- Downtime when maintenance is needed: When a system maintenance is to be done, the sytem has to be shut down for the maintenance to be done on it. This is because the system relies on a single server which host all the resouces needed to serve the client.

- Failure to scale in the instance of too much traffic: This web infrastructure has only one server and this makes it unscalable in the event of too much request made by users, the absence of any scaling mechanism such as an extra servers and a load balancer to help distribute request in the event of excess traffic on the server can lead to the system failing to handle such large amount of traffic.
